			<p>The attractive force which holds various constituents (atoms, ions, etc.) together in different chemical species is called a chemical bond. </p>

			<p> Since the
				formation of chemical compounds takes place as a result
				of combination of atoms of various elements in different
				ways, it raises many questions. Why do atoms combine?
				Why are only certain combinations possible? Why do some
				atoms combine while certain others do not? Why do
				molecules possess definite shapes? 

				<eq> Na → Na+ + e– </eq> 

				To answer such
				questions different theories and concepts have been put
				forward from time to time. These are <b>Kössel-Lewis
				approach </b>, <b> Valence Shell Electron Pair Repulsion (VSEPR)
				Theory </b>, <b>Valence Bond (VB) Theory </b> and <b>Molecular Orbital
				(MO) Theory </b>. The evolution of various theories of valence
				and the interpretation of the nature of chemical bonds have
				closely been r elated to the developments in the
				understanding of the structure of atom, the electronic
				configuration of elements and the periodic table.
